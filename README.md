## Motivation

If you've seen rices over at places like [r/unixp\*rn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/), every now and then you'll see some developer layouts where you'd have a code editor, then some eye candy to fill up dead space. I thought it would be nice to have some eye candy that was interactive.

And so, I thought a keyboard visualizer that updates no matter which window has focus would be pretty neat. You code away on your editor, and the ASCII keyboard on the corner lights up!

Practically, it could have a niche use as well, like sharing your screen with other people so ~~you can flex your Vim skills~~ they can see the keys you press as you navigate through your workflow.

## Installation

I recommend installing the program through Go:

```bash
go install github.com/arvingarciabtw/ditto/cmd/ditto@latest
```

Or you can install the program via the AUR:

```bash
yay -S ditto
# or
paru -S ditto
```

Or via the flake for nix users:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    ditto = {
      url = "github:arvingarciabtw/ditto";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };

  # ...
}
```

It's available under `ditto.packages.<system>.default`.

Before executing the program with `ditto`, refer to the [permissions](#permissions) section below. You can also specify flags when executing ditto, particularly for locking the keyboard. See the [usage](#usage) section for more details on that.

## Permissions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ditto reads raw evdev events from `/dev/input/event\*`, which isn't readable by normal users by default. You can grant the binary read access with:
>
> `sudo setcap cap_dac_read_search=ep "$(which ditto)"`
>
> The program will inform you about this when executing without permissions.
>
> This adds a single Linux capability (`cap_dac_read_search`) to the binary, so it only bypasses the DAC read check on `/dev/input/event*`, nothing else. The binary still runs as your user, not as root. You'd need to re-run it if you rebuilt the binary. You can revoke anytime with:
>
> `sudo setcap -r "$(which ditto)"`
>
> To my knowledge, this is the safer way of granting permissions. You could technically add the user to the input group and it would work, but that'd be more unsafe since that would grant full control over all devices under `/dev/input`.

> [!NOTE]
> Since Nix store paths change on every rebuild, you'll need to re-run `setcap` after updating the flake input.

## Usage

There are four main commands you need to be aware of: `l`, `s`, `d`, and `c`. Pressing `l` opens up the layout list, `s` opens up the size list, and `d` opens up the standard list. If your active standard is either JIS or KS, you can press `c` to toggle between the Latin alphabet and the standard's logograms.

> [!NOTE]
> For the JIS and KS standards to render the logograms properly, you need to have a compatible font installed in your system. I recommend Noto Sans CJK JP and Noto Sans CJK KR.

If you'd like to only see the keyboard, you can hide the informational text with `h`.

### Lists

#### Size List

<img width="1280" height="683" alt="size list demo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f6931fb-bcc6-49b7-80ff-d081a233886b" />

Press `s` to open the size list. This determines which physical key matrix the ASCII keyboard renders. Choose from compact 60% all the way up to full-size 100%.

<table width="100%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>Form Factor</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>60%</code></td><td>Compact, no F-row or arrows</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>65%</code></td><td>60% + arrow keys + nav cluster</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>75%</code></td><td>Has F-row, compact layout</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>80%</code></td><td>TKL — F-row, arrows, no numpad</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>96%</code></td><td>Compact full-size, includes numpad</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>100%</code></td><td>Full-size with everything</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Layout List

<img width="1280" height="683" alt="layout list demo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b48383d-e9f9-487d-bb19-d0b807461bda" />

Press `l` to open the layout list. This determines how the keys are remapped. Choose from popular layouts like QWERTY, Dvorak, Colemak, and more.

<table width="100%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Layout</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>qwerty</code></td><td>Standard US layout</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>qwerty uk</code></td><td>Standard UK layout</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>dvorak</code></td><td>Dvorak simplified</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>dvorak uk</code></td><td>Dvorak UK layout</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>colemak</code></td><td>Colemak modern alternative</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>colemak-dh</code></td><td>Colemak with angle mod</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>workman</code></td><td>Workman layout</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>azerty</code></td><td>French AZERTY</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Standard List

<img width="1280" height="683" alt="standard list demo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb3b48f3-7f5b-4459-9733-13957fa4f6ad" />

Press `d` to open the standard list. This determines the physical keyboard standard. Choose from ANSI, ISO, ABNT, JIS, or KS.

<table width="100%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Standard</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>ansi</code></td><td>American National Standards Institute</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>iso</code></td><td>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>abnt</code></td><td>Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>jis</code></td><td>Japanese Industrial Standard</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>ks</code></td><td>Korean Standard</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Custom Layouts

Custom layouts are loaded from JSON files placed in `~/.config/ditto/layouts/`.

Each `.json` file becomes a named layout (the filename without extension). Format:

```jsonc
{
  "map": {
    "A": "A",
    "S": "O",
    "D": "E",
    "F": "U",
    "G": "I",
    "H": "D",
    "J": "H",
    "K": "T",
    "L": "N",
    "Q": "'",
    "W": ",",
    "E": ".",
    // ...
  },
  "shift": {
    "1": "!",
    "2": "@", // ...
  },
}
```

- **map is required** — maps physical key labels → remapped labels (same format as the built-in layouts in layouts.go)
- **shift is optional** — shifted state mappings; falls back to shift mappings for qwerty us layout if omitted

The layout will automatically appear in the layout list the next time you launch Ditto.

### Lock

If you're happy with the current layout and want to keep that permanently every time you run the program, you can lock the keyboard with `ditto --lock`. Locking it means that your visual settings will not work. Bindings for opening up a list, toggling the TUI text with `h`, or toggling the logograms with `c` will intentionally not work.

Inversely, you can just do `ditto --unlock` to unlock the keyboard.

If you prefer, you can also just edit the config file at `~/.config/ditto/config.json` to change the value of the `locked` key.

## Roadmap

Some features I'm thinking of implementing in the future, not in order.

- [x] UK layouts
- [x] ANSI and ISO standards
- [x] Additional niche standards (JIS, ABNT, KS)
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Mac support
- [ ] Custom layouts via TUI
- [ ] Custom finger zones

## Contributing

I'm certainly not much of an experienced programmer, so any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

As I kept developing this program, I've learned that keyboards actually get pretty deep. For instance, check out this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_QWERTY_keyboard_language_variants) of QWERTY keyboard language variants. If you'd like to add a specific layout variant to the layout list, I'd appreciate a pull request or opening up an issue about it.

When writing my commit messages, I follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec, so I'd be glad if you followed this convention as well for your contributions for the sake of consistency.

If you're liking Ditto, I'd appreciate a star! Thanks again! ⭐

## Note on AI

I'm not an experienced programmer and I've only recently picked up Go, so I'm well aware that the codebase is subpar. I still don't have an eye for what is considered idiomatic Go or not.

I've used AI to assist me with making this project, notably for pointing me towards reliable resources like documentation and for easily doing tedious, repetitive tasks (especially so for when I was adding the key matrices for each keyboard standard's size).

In the cases where I couldn't figure out an implementation despite researching on my own, I did lean into AI for suggestions, and sometimes an initial prototype of an implementation. Rest assured that I did my best in reviewing these suggestions, and making appropriate changes along the way.

Of course, I'm certain the code can still be improved a lot more, so I'd be happy to hear any feedback or suggestions. If you'd like to contribute, you can refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section above.
